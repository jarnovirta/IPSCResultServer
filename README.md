# IPSCResultServer

A Java Web server for an IPSC shooting match result service. 

The server receives result data from an Android uploader App (uploading result data from PractiScore scoring app to server). The uploader is in Git repository https://github.com/jarnovirta/AndroidPractiScoreUploader. The uploader fetches match data from a [PractiScore](https://practiscore.com/) match data export file (.psc) and uploads the data to the server.

The web pages show match results, competitor statistics, as well as match analysis for competitors done using Google Charts.

Server running on www.hitfactor.fi.
